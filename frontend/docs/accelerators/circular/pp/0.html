<h2>Proton-proton beams</h2>
<ul>
<li>A proton proton collider produces a lot of data per second but there is a lot of background noise, so the signal events you are interested in can be hard to find</li>
<li>Proton-proton beams have a lot of backgorund noise because they collide protons. Protons are not elementary particles, they are made up of three quarks: up, up and down (uud). The high energy given to the protons by the collider allows more particles to be present in the proton. So it may contain more than three quarks and many gluons. So in every pp interaction there can be many different interactions between all the different particles inside a proton which creates a lot of different types of particles that hide the events you are interested in. Protons do produce syncotron radiation when they move through a bending magnetic field, but because of their high mass the effect is very small.</li>

<h2>Circular colliders</h2>
<ul>
<li>These accelerators are compact compared to some high energy linear accelerators as the same magnets and electric fields can be used because the beam travels in a circle.</li>
<li>These accelerators use magnets to constrain a beam of particles in a circle or spiral, and electric fields to accelrate them. </li>
<li>Cyclotron<ul>
<li>A cheap and compact acceletrator of charged particles with relatively high luminosity. However, it can't acceletrate particles to a very high energy because it doesn't adjust for relativistic effects.</li>
<li>A cyclotron is an early form of particle accelerator which produces charged particles at the center of a circle and uses rapidly varying RF electric fields to accelerate the particles. It uses a static magnetic field to keep the particles in a spiral trajectory away from the center of the circle. It can then fire the beam out in a stright line to use in experiments.

<li>Radius<ul>
<li>The radius of the circular collider determines the energy of the particles. The particles move in a circle due to magnetic fields. The radius of curvature depends on the energy of the particles and the strength of the magnetic field. See http://www.egglescliffe.org.uk/physics/particles/newfolder/acc1.html
