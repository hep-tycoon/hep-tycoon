== Electron-electron beams ==
 * Colliders with electron-electron beams have low energies but have clear good quality data compared to pp colliders
 * Electron-electron beams cannot have high energy because of synchrotron radiation. As the high velocity electrons move thorugh magnetic fields they emit electromagnetic energy which reduces their energy. So the electrons lose all of their energy. This is only true for circular accelerators. Linear accelerators do not suffer from this problem. Electron beams give good clear data and signals because electrons are fundamental particles with no substructure. In an interaction between electrons there is very little background noise.

== Linear colliders == 
These machines accelerate particles in a stright line. Such a device is usually called a Linac. High energy linacs need to be very long, so they take up a lot of space.
 * Linacs can have a fixed traget at the end, or a storage ring which can hold the beam for many hours. They can also accelerate two beams at the same time and bend them towards eachother for a collison.
