Electromagnetic Calorimeter ==
 * Measures the energy and position of charged and neutral particles.
 * When a particle interacts with an electromagnetic calorimeter it loses energy to atoms and other particles inside the detector. These secondary particles then give their energy to adjacent atoms and particles and a "partilce shower is created." The detector sees these showers and can add up the total energy of the shower to determine what the energy of the particle was. Sometimes particles are completely absorbed by the electromagnetic calorimeter and stop. Hadrons are detected in the electromagnetic calorimeters but they are not absorbed by them.

== Hadronic Calorimeter ==
 * These devices measure the energy and position of hadrons
 * Hadronic calorimeters work in a similar way to electromagnetic calorimeters but they mainly detect hadrons. Hadrons are particles made up of quarks and anti-quarks. Because they are not fundamental particles their interactions can be very complicated. Thus the "particle showers" in a hadronic calorimter are much larger than in an electromagnetic calorimeter.
