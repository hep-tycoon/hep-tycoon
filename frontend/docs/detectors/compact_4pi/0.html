<h2>Bubble Chamber</h2>
<ul>
<li>A bubble chamber is an old form of particle detector that detects and records the tracks of charged particles</li>
<li>Bubble chambers contain a superheated liquid. When charged particles pass thorugh the liquid they vapourize it which results in the formation of bubbles along the particles track. These detectors were used historically to detect cosmic rays and were not used with accelerators.
