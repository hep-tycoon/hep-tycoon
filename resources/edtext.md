#Colliders/Accelerators

* Accelerators increase the velocity and energy of particles and usually output the particle vie a pipe to be used in an experiement
* Colliders usually accelerate two beams of particles and brings them together at a collison point inside a detector. 
1. ee beams
 * Colliders with electron electron beams have low energies but have clear good quality data compared to pp colliders
 * ee beams cannot have high energy because of syncotron radiation. As the high velocity electrons move thorugh magnetic fields they emit this electromagnetic energy which reduces their energy. So the electrons loose all of their energy. This is only true for circular accelerators. Linear accelerators do not suffer from this problem. Electron beams give good clear data and signals because electrons are fundamental particles with no substructure. In an interaction between electrons there is very little background noise.
 * Example: http://home.web.cern.ch/about/accelerators/large-electron-positron-collider
2. pp beams
 * A proton proton collider produces a lot of data per second but there is a lot of background noise, so the signal events you are interested in can be hard to find
 * pp beams have a lot of backgorund noise because they collide protons. Protons are not elementary particles, they are made up of three quarks, up up and down (uud). The high energy given to the protons by the collider allows more particles to be present in the proton. So it may contain more than three quarks and many gluons. So in every pp interaction there can be many different interactions between all the different particles inside a proton which creates a lot of different types of particles that hide the events you are interested in. Proton's do produce syncotron radiation when they move through a bending magnetic field, but because of their high mass the effect is very small.

3. linear
 * These machines accelerate particles in a stright line. Such a device is usually called a Linac. High energy linacs need to be very long, so take up a lot of space. Their disadvantage is 
 * Linacs can have a fixed traget at the end, or a storage ring which can hold the beam for many hours. They can also accelerate two beams at the same time and bend them towards eachother for a collison.

4. Circular
 * These accelerators 
 * Cyclotron
    	+ A cheap and compact acceletrator of charged particles with relatively high luminosity. However, it can't acceletrate particles to a very high energy because it doesn't adjust for relativistic effects 
    	+ A cyclotron is an early form of particle accelerator which produces charged particles at the center of a circle and uses rapidly varying RF electric fields to accelerate the particles. It uses a static magnetic field to keep the particles in a spiral trajectory away from the center of the circle. It can then fire the beam out in a stright line to use in experiments.

 * Syncotron
    	+ A syncotron is a more advanced cyclotron that that takes relitivitic effect into account and so can accelerate particles to higher energies
    	+ Cyclotrons have a fixed magnetic field. Syncotrons have time dependant magentic field which allows you to to keep the beam moving in a circle of a fixed radius rather than a siral. These devices can have different types of magnets, each with a specific job. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron

 * Radius
 	+ The radius of the circular collider determines the energy of the particles. The particles move in a circle due to magnetic fields. The radius of curvature depends on the energy of the particles and the strength of the magnetic field. See http://www.egglescliffe.org.uk/physics/particles/newfolder/acc1.html

5. Modules
 * dipole magnets
    	+ These magnets keep the particle beam moving in the right direction. They don't accelerate the beam. Most of the LHC is made of dipole magnets.
    	+ A dipole magnet is an electromagnet used in particle accelerators to create a homogeneous magnetic field over some distance. Particle motion in that field will be circular in a plane perpendicular to the field and collinear to the direction of particle motion and free in the direction orthogonal to it. Thus, a particle injected into a dipole magnet will travel on a circular or helical trajectory. By adding several dipole sections on the same plane, the bending radial effect of the beam increases.

 * Quadrupole magnets
    	+ These magnets focus the beam in one direction. Two of these magnets work together to squeeze the beam, first in one direction, and then another.
    	+ A quadrupole magnet is made up of four magnets arranged so that the force on a beam of charged particles is towards the center of the beam in one direction. Two of these types of magnets in series but with 90 degree orientations to each other, focus the particle beam.
![alt text](/img/Quadrupole.png "Quadrupole schematic")
 * RF accelerators
    	+ These devices use electric fields to accelerate the beam according to Lorenz law. This force tells us that a magnetic field can only change a particles direction, and an electric field can change its acceleration and direction.
    	+ These devices use electric fields to accelerate the beam according to Lorenz law. This force tells us that a magnetic field can only change a particles direction, and an electric field can change its acceleration and direction. In colliders the particle beam is actually made up of many bunches of particles. Between the bunches is just empty space. The electirc fields vary in time so that when a bunch is approaching the field they are pulled towards it, and when the bunch passes the center of the device, the field flips and the bunch is forced away from the device. This accelerates the bunches. In the following picture the electric field is generated by the devices in the center of the beam pipe, and the bunches pass through the hles in the center.

 * Kicker magnets
 		+ Kicker magnets can, very quickly, move a beam from a circular trajectory to a straight line trajectory or vise versa
 		+ Usually large particle colliders have smaller colliders that speed up the bunches before they are injected into the main collider. Kicker magnets can, very quickly, move a beam from a circular trajectory to a straight line trajectory or vise versa. So they enable accelerators to be connected to eachother. They can also connect the accelerator to the beam dump. The Kicker magnet needs to turn on and off extremely quickly. It must be able to turn on in the time between one bunch and the next. This can be as small as 25 nano seconds (ns).

 * Beam dump
 		+ This system increases safety by allowing the operator to dump the beam if there is a problem
 		+ Typical beam dumps are made of large blocks of graphite to absorb the beam. Magnets are used to unfocus the beam before if reaches the beam dump so that it has less intensity.

 * Collimators
 	+ These are used to shape the beam
 	+ Like the beam dump, these devices absorb particles which have moved too far away from the center of the beam. Usually collimators are placed before detectors to p
