#Colliders/Accelerators

* Accelerators increase the velocity and energy of particles and usually output the particle vie a pipe to be used in an experiement
* Colliders usually accelerate two beams of particles and brings them together at a collison point inside a detector. 
1. ee beams
 * Colliders with electron electron beams have low energies but have clear good quality data compared to pp colliders
 * ee beams cannot have high energy because of syncotron radiation. As the high velocity electrons move thorugh magnetic fields they emit this electromagnetic energy which reduces their energy. So the electrons loose all of their energy. This is only true for circular accelerators. Linear accelerators do not suffer from this problem. Electron beams give good clear data and signals because electrons are fundamental particles with no substructure. In an interaction between electrons there is very little background noise.

2. pp beams
 * A proton proton collider produces a lot of data per second but there is a lot of background noise, so the signal events you are interested in can be hard to find
 * pp beams have a lot of backgorund noise because they collide protons. Protons are not elementary particles, they are made up of three quarks, up up and down (uud). The high energy given to the protons by the collider allows more particles to be present in the proton. So it may contain more than three quarks and many gluons. So in every pp interaction there can be many different interactions between all the different particles inside a proton which creates a lot of different types of particles that hide the events you are interested in. Proton's do produce syncotron radiation when they move through a bending magnetic field, but because of their high mass the effect is very small.

3. linear
 * These machines accelerate particles in a stright line. Such a device is usually called a Linac. High energy linacs need to be very long, so take up a lot of space.
 * Linacs can have a fixed traget at the end, or a storage ring which can hold the beam for many hours. They can also accelerate two beams at the same time and bend them towards eachother for a collison.

4. Circular
 * Cyclotron
    	+ A cheap and compact acceletrator of charged particles with relatively high luminosity. However, it can't acceletrate particles to a very high energy because it doesn't adjust for relativistic effects 
    	+ A cyclotron is an early form of particle accelerator which produces charged particles at the center of a circle and uses rapidly varying RF electric fields to accelerate the particles. It uses a static magnetic field to keep the particles in a spiral trajectory away from the center of the circle. It can then fire the beam out in a stright line to use in experiments.

 * Syncotron
    	+ A syncotron is a more advanced cyclotron that that takes relitivitic effect into account and so can accelerate particles to higher energies
    	+ These devices can have different types of magnets, each with a specific job. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron

 * Radius/energy/etc.
5. Modules
 * dipole magnets
    	+ These magnets keep the particle beam moving in the right direction. They don't accelerate the beam. Most of the LHC is made of dipole magnets.
 * Quadrupole magnets
    	+ These magnets focus the beam in one direction. Two of these magnets work together to squeeze the beam, first in one direction, and then another.
 * RF accelerators
    	+ These devices use electric fileds to accelerate the beam according to Lorenz law. This force tells us that a magnetic field can only change a particles direction, and an electric field can change its acceleration and direction.
 * Kicker magnets
 * Beam dump
 * Collimaters
 * bunches
