#Colliders

1. ee
2. pp
3. linear
4. Circular
 * Radius/energy/etc.
5. Modules
 * dipole magnets
    * These magnets keep the particle beam moving in the right direction. They don't accelerate the beam. Most of the LHC is made of dipole magnets
 * Quadrupole magnets
  + These magnets focus the beam in one direction
 * RF accelerators
  + these devices use electric fileds to accelerate the beam according to Lorenz law. This force tells us that a magnetic field can only change a particles direction, and an electric field can only change its acceleration
 * Kicker magnets
 * Beam dump
 * Collimaters
 * bunches
6. Luminosity
