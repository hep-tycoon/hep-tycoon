 * Cyclotron
    	+ A cyclotron is an early form of particle accelerator which produces charged particles at the center of a circle and uses rapidly varying RF electric fields to accelerate the particles. It uses a static magnetic field to keep the particles in a spiral trajectory away from the center of the circle.

 * Syncotron
 * Radius/energy/etc.
5. Modules
 * dipole magnets
    	+ These magnets keep the particle beam moving in the right direction. They don't accelerate the beam. Most of the LHC is made of dipole magnets.
 * Quadrupole magnets
    	+ These magnets focus the beam in one direction. Two of these magnets work together to squeeze the beam, first in one direction, and then another.
 * RF accelerators
    	+ These devices use electric fileds to accelerate the beam according to Lorenz law. This force tells us that a magnetic field can only change a particles direction, and an electric field can change its acceleration and direction.
 * Kicker magnets
 * Beam dump
 * Collimaters
 * bunches
6. Luminosity

#Detectors (different sections)

1. muon chambers
2. hadronic calorimeter
3. electromagnetic calorimeter
4. vertex locator
 * These devices measure the point in space where an interaction takes place. They are placed very close to the particle bema.
