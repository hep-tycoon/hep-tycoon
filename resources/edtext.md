 * Cyclotron
    	+ A cheap and compact acceletrator of charged particles with relatively high luminosity. However, it can't acceletrate particles to a very high energy because it doesn't adjust for relativistic effects 
    	+ A cyclotron is an early form of particle accelerator which produces charged particles at the center of a circle and uses rapidly varying RF electric fields to accelerate the particles. It uses a static magnetic field to keep the particles in a spiral trajectory away from the center of the circle. It can then fire the beam out in a stright line to use in experiments.

 * Syncotron
    	+ A syncotron is a more advanced cyclotron that that takes relitivitic effect into account and so can accelerate particles to higher energies
    	+ These devices can have different types of magnets, each with a specific job. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron

 * Radius/energy/etc.
5. Modules
 * dipole magnets
    	+ These magnets keep the particle beam moving in the right direction. They don't accelerate the beam. Most of the LHC is made of dipole magnets.
 * Quadrupole magnets
    	+ These magnets focus the beam in one direction. Two of these magnets work together to squeeze the beam, first in one direction, and then another.
 * RF accelerators
    	+ These devices use electric fileds to accelerate the beam according to Lorenz law. This force tells us that a magnetic field can only change a particles direction, and an electric field can change its acceleration and direction.
 * Kicker magnets
 * Beam dump
 * Collimaters
 * bunches
6. Luminosity

#Detectors (different sections)

1. muon chambers
2. hadronic calorimeter
3. electromagnetic calorimeter
4. vertex locator
 * These devices measure the point in space where an interaction takes place. They are placed very close to the particle bema.
