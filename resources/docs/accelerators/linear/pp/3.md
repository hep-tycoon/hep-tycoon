## Proton-proton beams
 * A proton proton collider produces a lot of data per second but there is a lot of background noise, so the signal events you are interested in can be hard to find
 * Proton-proton beams have a lot of backgorund noise because they collide protons. Protons are not elementary particles, they are made up of three quarks: up, up and down (uud). The high energy given to the protons by the collider allows more particles to be present in the proton. So it may contain more than three quarks and many gluons. So in every pp interaction there can be many different interactions between all the different particles inside a proton which creates a lot of different types of particles that hide the events you are interested in. Protons do produce syncotron radiation when they move through a bending magnetic field, but because of their high mass the effect is very small.

## Linear colliders 
These machines accelerate particles in a stright line. Such a device is usually called a Linac. High energy linacs need to be very long, so they take up a lot of space.
 * Linacs can have a fixed traget at the end, or a storage ring which can hold the beam for many hours. They can also accelerate two beams at the same time and bend them towards eachother for a collison.
