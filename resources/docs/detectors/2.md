## Tracker
 * These devices, also called vertex locators, measure the point in space where an interaction takes place. They are placed very close to the particle beam.
 * A vertex locator is a very precise and accurate device made from silicon whoes job it is to measure the tracks of particles and from this determine at what point in space the particle was created. Hence they determine where the collison point was. They must be sensitive enough to resolve two vertecies which may be extremely close together.
