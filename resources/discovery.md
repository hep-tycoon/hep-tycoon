Particles to be Discovered by Level
===================================

* four levels

# Template:

* Some Particle
* Some description
* Image path

# Level 1:

* W boson
* We see a clear signal of a new particle in our data. This is a guage boson. One of the class of particles that mediate the four fundamental forces of nature. We call our new particle the W boson. The W boson mediates the weak force. It exists in two forms with charges of -1 and +1. They have huge masses of about 80 Ge/c^2. 

# Level 2:

* Z boson
* Another clear signal of a new particle. We call our discovery the Z boson. It is a gauge boson, one of the class of particles that mediate the four fundamental forces of nature. The Z boson mediates the weak force. It has neutral charge and a high mass of about 91 GeV/C^2. Your experiments hint that there is more about the weak force to discover.
