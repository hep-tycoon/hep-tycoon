Particles to be Discovered by Level
===================================

* four levels

# Template:

* Some Particle
* Some description
* Image path

# Level 1:

* W and Z bosons
* We see a clear signal of two new particle in our data. They are guage bosons, a class of particles that mediate the four fundamental forces of nature. We call our new particle the W and Z bosons. These bosons mediate the weak force. The w boson exists in two forms with charges of -1 and +1 and has a huge mass of about 80 Ge/c^2. The Z boson has netural charge and has a mass of about 91 GeV/c^2

# Level 2:

* Charm and Bottom quarks
* We have confirmed the theoretical predictions made 10 years ago that there are more types of quarks. We have seen evidence for the J/psi particle and have deduced it contains a charm quark. We have seen a meson which we will call the B meson. We now know it contains a new type of quark. The bottom quark. Now we must investigate the possiblity that CP symmetry is violated.
