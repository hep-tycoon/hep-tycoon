Particles to be Discovered by Level
===================================

* four levels

# Template:

* Some Particle
* Some description
* Image path

# Level 1:

* W and Z bosons
* We see a clear signal of two new particle in our data. They are guage bosons, a class of particles that mediate the four fundamental forces of nature. We call our new particle the W and Z bosons. These bosons mediate the weak force. The w boson exists in two forms with charges of -1 and +1 and has a huge mass of about 80 Ge/c^2. The Z boson has netural charge and has a mass of about 91 GeV/c^2

# Level 2:

* Charm and Bottom quarks
* We have confirmed the theoretical predictions made 10 years ago that there are more types of quarks. We have seen evidence for the J/psi particle and have deduced it contains a charm quark. We have seen a meson which we will call the B meson. We now know it contains a new type of quark. The bottom quark. Now we must investigate the possiblity that CP symmetry is violated.

# Level 3:

* Higgs Boson
* We have done it. We have discoverd the particle predicted 50 years ago that is the last missing piece of the standard model. We have observed the decay of the higgs boson into two photons.

# Level 4:

* up squark
* We have clear evidence from our experiments that the up squark exists. This is conclusive proof of super symmetry. Now we have to find proof that all particles have super symmetric partners.
