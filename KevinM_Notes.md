* Start by making up a reasearch organisation name (YES)
	* Maybe you pick a head scientists and a few starting scientists which have different bonuses and are part of your research organisation
	* These initial scientists will be better than the ones who turn up at the start of the game, just to get you going
	* Your director is selected from these organisation scientists
* World map where you buy your green field site
* The better your rating the better the scientists   
* Higher INFLUENCE lets you get better grants.  (YES)
	* The better your experiments work (collisions per second) the better your influence
	* Good Scientists bring influence
	* Holding conferences etc. 
* Pop up windows with little tasks  (YES)
	* Save the summer student from the tunnels
	* End of the world scenario ???? (don't think the judges would like this
	* Visiting dignatory
	* Film crew
	* Tom Hanks
* I think it should be more like "Sim Hospital" than "Roller coaster tycoon"
* Buildables  
	* Experiments (YES)
		+ Start small with proton or electron (cheap) or whatever source, neutrino source (expensive)
		+ Linear
			- Better quality
		+ Circular
			- Better rate
			- You should be able to pick the colliding particle and the TeV, which determines the radius
			- Determine how  many dipoles(maybe a default)/quadrupoles(increase focus and luminosity, collisions per second)/beam dump (improves safety)/ can attach colliders together with kicker magnets and connecting lines/RF accelerators.
		+ Collider
			- Ee
				+ Better quality
			- PP
				+ Better rate
			- Can tune your device to  what ever levels you want
				+ But need certain pre accelerators to do certain things 
					- Booster 
					- Etc.
				+ Bunch number
				+ Density
				+ Energy
				+ But can have an accident if you go too high
				+ Beam dump prevents an accident 
			- Detectors
				+ You can choose the layout of your detector. Choose what layer comes first in the onion
				+ Choose shape, like CMS or LHCb. Different shapes?
			- Workshops
				+ Means you don’t have to import materials
				+ Things are cheaper
			- Antimatter
			- Also other experiments
				+ Neutrino experiment
				+ Cosmic observatory 
				+ Gravitational waves
				+ Others  …
		+ Buildings (NOT YET)
			§ Restaurant(subsidised and not subsidised)
			§ Theaters (makes summer students and Ph.D students smarter, scientists happier, increases publications, can hold conferences if its big enough)  
			§ Bar (happiness)
			§ BBQ area (:p)
			§ Hostel (can't have summer students without it)
			§ Tunnel system 
				□ makes summer students happy
				□ Maybe these tunnels should develop naturally to connect buildings (coding challenge)
				□ Summer student temple 
			§ Something to do with internet connection
* People
		○ You must  attract SCIENTISTS by having a good rating (YES)
			§ Give scientists names
			§ maybe you can choose which ones you want, have to have enough office space for everyone
			§ If you don't have nice services they will be unhappy and the good ones will leave.
			§ They should have a rate of publication statistic. And an INFLUENCE
			§ These scientists are not part of your organisation, so you cannot take them with you to a new site. They are like garden variety scientists. Your organisation scientists are better
			§ But you can hire these ordinary scientists into your organisation, where they can become director
		○ Summer students
			§ Add a bit of fun and randomness
			§ Don't really do anything else
		○ Tourists can also come so you can set up exhibitions for them. 
			§ They must pay in. 
			§ Gift shop etc. 
		○ Ph.D students
			§ No influence
			§ Like scientists but can’t do as much
			§ When they write their thesis they may or may not become scientists, and if they do, they will probably stay with your organisation  
		○ Fanatics
			§ Cause trouble (judges won't like this)
			§ Must have security
		○ Staff
			§ Security (safety, prevent fanatics)
			§ Cleaning (happiness of staff)
			§ Gift shop/reception/tour guides (money)
* Money (YES)
		○ Called  ?
			§ Fermi's?
			§ Dirac Dollars ?
			§ CERNmilions ?
			§ Jetons
		○ You make money from publications and events like conferences
			§ More scientists more publications, more and better experiments means more scientists
		○ Have to pay for electricity
* Graphics (NOT YET)
		○ Simple green starting canvas
		○ With a grid to add different sized buildings and roads
		○ Circular accelerators will be a challenge
		○ Automatically connnecting buildings with tunnels will be a challenge.
		○ Building accelerator connections and things will be like making train tracks. Under or over ground
* Choose goal at start (NOT YET)
		○ Neutrino physics
		○ Higgs search
		○ CPV search
		○ SUSY
